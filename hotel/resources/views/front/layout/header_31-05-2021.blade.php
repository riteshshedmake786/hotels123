                                    which Venues Providers&mdash;in their professional conduct of business (i.e. B2C or
                                    B2B)&mdash;can advertise, market, sell, promote, and/or offer (as applicable) their
                                    Venues and related service for reservation and through which relevant visitors of

                                    Service), you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with
                                    the Venue Providers with which you make a reservation (as applicable). From the
                                    point at which you make your Venues Reservation, we act solely as an intermediary
                                    between you and the Venue Providers, transmitting the relevant details of your
                                    Venues Reservation to the relevant Venue Providers(s) and sending you a confirmation
                                    email for and on behalf of the Venue Providers. HV does not (re)sell, rent out,

                                    of each Venue Providers page on our Platform) and important information in your

                                    of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Venue Providers agrees or allows
                                    otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.</p>
                                <p>If you want to review, adjust, or cancel your Venues Reservation, revert to the
                                    confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Note that you may be charged
                                    for your cancellation in accordance with the Venue Providers&apos; cancellation,
                                    (pre)payment and no-show policy, or not be entitled to any repayment of any

                                <p><br></p>
                                <p>If applicable and available, certain Venues Providers offer the opportunity for
                                    Venues Reservation Reservations to be paid (wholly or partly and as required under
                                    the payment policy of the Venue Providers) to the Venue Providers during the Venues
                                    Reservation process, by means of secure online payment (all to the extent offered
                                    and supported by your bank). For certain products and services, HV facilitates
                                    (through third party payment processors) the payment of the relevant product or
                                    service (i.e. the payment facilitation service) for and on behalf of the Venue
                                    Providers (HV never acts nor operates as the merchant of record). Payment is safely
                                    processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the
                                    accommodation provider through a third-party payment processor. Any payment
                                    facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the Venue Providers will
                                    in each case constitute a payment of (part of) the booking price by you of the
                                    relevant product or service in final settlement of such (partial) due and payable
                                    price and you cannot reclaim such paid monies.</p>

                                <p>For certain (non-refundable) rates or special offers, note that Venues Providers may
                                    require that payment be made upfront by wire transfer (if available) or by credit
                                    card, and therefore your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged (sometimes
                                    without any option for refund) upon making the Venues Reservation. Check the
                                    (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such
                                    conditions prior to making your Venue Reservation. You will not hold HV liable or
                                    responsible for any (authorized, (allegedly) unauthorized or wrong) charge by the
                                    Venue Providers and not (re)claim any amount for any valid or authorized charge by
                                    the Venue Providers (including for pre-paid rates, no-show, and chargeable
                                    cancellation) of your credit card.</p>

                                <p>In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third
                                    parties, most banks and credit card companies bear the risk and cover all charges
                                    resulting from such fraud or misuse, which may sometimes be subject to a
